# Matrix Methods For Orbital Mechanics
 
This repository contains the code and paper for my applied matrix methods final report. The code I have written myself is in the main directory; the code I have used from the [NASA CARA SDK](https://github.com/nasa/CARA_Analysis_Tools) is in the dependencies directory.
